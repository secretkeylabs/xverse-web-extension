# Fee Editor

The fee editor fetches for fees on mount, even if it is not opened, so as to increase the chances that fee data will be available when the user opens the editor, thus helping avoid a momentary "blank" UI while data loads, since data-loading designs are not yet available.

Once designs are available, the editor may be updated to better handle loading behavior and its UI behavior.
